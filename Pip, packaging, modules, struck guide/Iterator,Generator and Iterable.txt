Iterator vs Generator vs Iterable 

Iterable :returns one element at a time. lists, tuples etc are iterable
terables are objects that can return one of their elements at a time, such as a list. 

Many of the built-in functions weâ€™ve used so far, like 'enumerate,' return an iterator.
Generator : A function that creates an iterator
Iterator : An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data

Generator Eg:

def my_range(x):
	i=0
	while i < x:
		yield i
		i+1
yield keyword is a differentiator between a generator and a function.
